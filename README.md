the task Task is "Chess Pro!" Yesterday I gave a task to prepare a divided background with 3 tones of green. Today the task is creating 8x8 chess board with gradient squares. Class usage is forbidden. Just pseudo selectors are aloud. Color codes are here: #FDFCFB , #E2D1C3 and #434343 , #000000

Of-course designing a colorful chess board is OK but the output should be like a chess board. Odd and even rows has different starts! To solve this issue please focus as well.

Board exactly should play on the middle of the screen like "contain" position in CSS. So you need to use minimum of browser sizes as size of chess board edge. With this way your chess board always be perfect and responsive! You should just a small research for that.

Extra challenge: Make all piece of Chess a flip card and put the chess figures behind of the squares. Squares should flip when you hover. Also on the middle of the board put the letters of your name. When you hover here letter by letter your name would be shown.
